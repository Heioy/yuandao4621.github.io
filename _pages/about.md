Hi! My name is xxxx. I'm a Taiwanese American writer based in Southern California, an alum from UC Santa Barbara. As a recent grad, I'm still looking for full-time work (such as copywriting, entertainment journalism, etc). In the meantime, I decided to build a website with Github Pages to blog and post short stories. After a lot of research and experimentation, **alinwrites** was created.
