```

解决思路：

根据报错找到对应的文件，查看了文件权限，发现是 oracle 权限，将文件修改为 `grid:oinstall`

```bash
#grid@com92:/home/grid>ls -lh /opt/oraInventory/ContentsXML/oui-patch.xml
-rw-r--r-- 1 oracle oinstall 174 Dec 22 15:56 /opt/oraInventory/ContentsXML/oui-patch.xml
#grid@com92:/home/grid>chown grid:oinstall /opt/oraInventory/ContentsXML/oui-patch.xml
```

修改权限后执行 `opatchauto resume`

解决思路

提示文件不存在时，尝试从 RAC1节点 将对应文件 scp 到 2节点上，如果RAC 1节点上不存在对应的文件，可向上查找上一级目录，以此类推

```bash
#grid@com91:/tmp>ls -lh /opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/32585572/etc/config/actions
ls: cannot access /opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/32585572/etc/config/actions: No such file or directory
#grid@com91:/tmp>ls -lh /opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/32585572/etc/config/inventory
ls: cannot access /opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/32585572/etc/config/inventory: No such file or directory
#grid@com91:/tmp>ls -lh /opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/32585572/etc/config/
total 8.0K
-rw-r--r-- 1 grid oinstall 2.1K Dec 22 15:34 actions.xml
-rw-r----- 1 grid oinstall 2.1K Oct 15 14:21 inventory.xml
#grid@com91:/tmp>scp -r /opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/32585572 grid@10.10.90.92:/opt/grid/products/19.3.0/inventory/oneoffs/
inventory.xml                                                      100% 2081     3.9MB/s   00:00
actions.xml                                                        100% 2081     5.2MB/s   00:00
```

然后执行 `opatchauto resume`
